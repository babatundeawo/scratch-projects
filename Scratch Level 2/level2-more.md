# ðŸŸ¡ Scratch Level 2 â€“ Project Links & Descriptions

Here are the Scratch projects in Level 2, each with a direct link and a fuller explanation of what you will build and learn:

| Project | Description | Link |
|---|-------------|------|
| **Broadcasting Spells** | Use Scratch's **broadcast / receive** blocks to send messages between sprites. Create magical spells or effects triggered by events. | <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/broadcasting-spells> |
| **Grow a Dragonfly** | Program a dragonfly sprite to **grow or change size** based on user actions or events â€” involves variables and visual effects. | <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/grow-a-dragonfly> |
| **Drum Star** | Build a digital drum set: sprites act as drum pads. Use **sound blocks** and **auditory feedback**, so clicking or pressing keys triggers drums. | <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/drum-star> |
| **Next Customer Please** | Simulate a queue system for customers: use variables, broadcasting, and interactivity so sprites serve in turn. | <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/next-customer-please> |
| **Donâ€™t Fall In** | Create a game where sprites must avoid falling or staying in unsafe zones. Use conditionals and motion blocks to control the game. | <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dont-fall-in> |
| **This Sprite Needs You** | Make a helper or companion sprite that responds to events, messages, or sprite interactions to assist the user. | <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/this-sprite-needs-you> |
