## 📖 Learning Path

### 🟢 [Scratch - Level 1: *Introduction to Scratch*](https://github.com/babatundeawo/scratch-projects/blob/main/01_level1-introduction.md)
- Sprites, scripts, and loops  
- Learn how to add **code, costumes, and sounds** to sprites.  
- Build fun projects like:
  - Animations  
  - A simple game  
  - A small app  
  - An interactive book  

**Progress:** No Progress

### 🟡 [Scratch - Level 2: *More Scratch*](https://github.com/babatundeawo/scratch-projects/blob/main/02_level2-more.md)
- Broadcast, decisions, and variables  
- Move beyond the basics and create:
  - Apps  
  - Games  
  - Simulations  

You will use **message broadcasting**, **if...then** decisions, and **variables** to add more power to your projects.

**Progress:** No Progress

### 🔵 [Scratch - Level 3: *Further Scratch*](https://github.com/babatundeawo/scratch-projects/blob/main/03_level3-further.md)
- Clones, my blocks, and Boolean logic  
- Advance your skills by making:
  - Games  
  - Computer-generated art  
  - Apps  
  - Simulations  

You’ll work with **Boolean logic**, **functions (My Blocks)**, and **clones** to create more complex programs.

**Progress:** No Progress
