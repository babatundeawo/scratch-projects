# üü¢ Scratch Level 1 ‚Äì Project Links & Descriptions

Here are the Scratch projects in Level 1, each with a direct link and a richer description of what you will build and learn:

| Project | Description | Link |
|---|-------------|------|
| **Space Talk** | Create a space scene where characters ‚Äúemote‚Äù to share their thoughts or feelings. You will: add sprites & backdrops; use `Looks` and `Sound` blocks; make characters respond when clicked; use the Paint editor to change costumes. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} | https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/space-talk |
| **Catch the Bus** | Animate sprites that run or fly to catch a bus. Use events and motion blocks so sprites move when the green flag is clicked. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} | https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus |
| **Find the Bug** | Build a game in which you have to find a hidden ‚Äúbug‚Äù (sprite) on each level. The game includes start and end backdrops and a timer to track how fast you find the bug. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} | https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/find-the-bug |
| **Silly Eyes** | Create a character whose large eyes follow the mouse pointer. Use sensing blocks and motion to make the eyes move dynamically, making the character appear alive. | https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/silly-eyes |
| **Surprise Animation** | Develop a visual animation that surprises and delights ‚Äî combining movement, looks, and sounds to create an effect. | https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/surprise-animation |
| **I Made You a Book** | Design a digital book. You‚Äôll decide what type of book to create, who it‚Äôs for, and add pages so readers can ‚Äúturn‚Äù through them. | https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/i-made-you-a-book |
